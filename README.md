### Notes
It is not a really a challenge, but I first notice that when you create a collection view in main board, there is a new block called content view instead of nothing as shown in the video. Even though using the same code from the video work, I am still a little hesitant to implememnt it so I check what it is online. It seems like Apple add content view to collection view cell in a later version. I will try my best to do the bonus, but I am quite busy due to studying for midterm.
